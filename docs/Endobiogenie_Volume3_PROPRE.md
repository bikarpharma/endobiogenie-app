This book is dedicated to our patients: fortuitous teachers whose confi-

dence in us, and challenges to find better methods of care have served as

a daily inspiration. They have nourished our research in a permanent trust

and sharing which allowed the emergence of this new approach to Life that

represents Endobiogeny.

Summary of terrain The precritical hyperimmunity terrain has three aspects: The primary focus of the classical biomedical approach has overfabrication of immune elements, spasmophilia, and been to focus exclusively on suppressing the mechanisms permissive adrenal cortex activity.

FIG. 1.2 Sensitization to allergens and manifestation of allergies. (A) Primary sensitization involves local macrophages (dendritic cell), which forms an epitope with a native T cell. Memory T - cells are formed and B cells activated to develop IgE receptors. (B) Shows that in the initial exposure, there is a rise in the number of IgE and T cells. Because IgE has not been released to circulating, symptoms are latent. On sec - ond exposure ((A) lower half), there is a proliferation of memory T - cells. Based on the balance of T regulatory cells to other lymphocytes, the response can be regulated or amplified ((B) middle and lower graphs). With subsequent exposure (C) in susceptible individuals, an immediate, then late phase reaction can develop. There is an IgE mediated response, with degranulation of mast cells and activation of basophils. Antigen presenting cells (APC’s) stimulate non - IgE dependent mechanisms of response including pro - inflammatory and immune activating interleu - kins and eosinophils.

FIG. 1.3 Alpha stimulates ACTH and TRH. There is an insufficient cortisol response to ACTH. As ACTH continues its stimulation to readapt cortisol to the Endobiogenic requirements of the organism, it upregulates histamine receptors in anticipation of TRH’s actions. It mobilizes eosinophils and basophils to act in the time with insufficient cortisol. Finally, it stimulates the release of T - lymphocytes from the thymus. TRH stimulates the release of histamines, which prolong the time of alpha and play an important role in allergy symptoms. It also stimulates TSH, which in the long term stimulates the maturation of T - lymphocytes released by the thymus. TRH stimulates the conversion of T4 to T3, which increases the rate of oxidative burst, participating in the general in - flammatory milieu. The release of interleukins, from T - cells, from Alpha, etc. creates an inflammatory environment that allows for the extravasation of T - cells. T - cells stimulate B cells that release IgE, which further stimulates basophils and other inflammatory mediators. (© 2015 Systems Biology Research Group.)

through hydroelectric fluctuations that precede aldosterone

and the implications of what aldosterone shall bring. Thus,

in eczema, we evaluate the ACTH index in structure. The

adaption - permissivity is presented in structure, again, re-

lated to the adaptive activity of the adrenal cortex in rela-

tion to its permissive in structuro - functional adaptation. It

is quantitatively elevated, slightly favoring adaptation, but

negative. The negative sign indicates that the actual achieve-

ment is not occurring as anticipated by the absolute value.

The permissive actions of the adrenal cortex predominate,

distorting the orderly process of anabolism, participating in

the irregular, disorderly arrangement of the proteinaceous

plaques in eczema. Finally, the rate of aromatization of ad-

renal androgens to adrenal estrogens is elevated, indicating

there is a source of estrogens to drive hyperimmunity and

not effectively hypothyroid, but had a latent hypothyroid, as

concluded by the low genito - thyroid and thyroid yield. The

importance of the TSH is that it created profound imbal-

ances within the somatotropic axis (Table 1.22).

In the gonadotropic axis, we mention three indexes

(Table 1.23). The FSH index is elevated, which indicates a congesting role of mucosal tissue. This is occurring because the organotissular estrogen yield is low. The conclusion is

that relative to the intensity and duration of FSH activity, the

organotissular activity of estrogens is insufficient. The tissular

endocrinometabolic activity of estrogens is also insufficient

Alpha sympathetic ( αΣ) stimulates (red arrow) ACTH to calibrate precortisol corticotropic defense and mobilization. ACTH increases the number of histamine receptors, stimulates eosinophils and basophils, and, T - lymphocyte excretion from the thymus. Alpha stimulates TRH to calibrate thyrotropic activity. TRH stimulates the release of histamine from circulating cells. This compliments the actions of ACTH in upregulating the number of histamine receptors. Histamines, now released, can prolong alpha in a positive feedback loop. Alpha stimulates the release of pro - inflammatory interleukins. Together with histamine and increased histamine receptors, they create an inflammatory terrain that allows nutrients, humoral, and cellular factors to extravasate from hematogenous circulation into affected tissues. ACTH stimulates cortisol, but due to the insufficient response, there is insufficient inhibition of these processes. The net result favors a dysregulated hyperimmune state.

FSH and LH excretion patterns widely vary in circadian cycles as well as throughout the grand phases of life. During fetogenesis, FSH predominates because androgens are derived from the adrenal cortex. During reproductive years, it is the opposite. Note that both the total output and frequency of variation is key to fertility. (Reproduced from Barbara L. Hoffman et al. Williams Gynecology, 3rd ed., 2016. © McGraw - Hill Education.)

reduction of ACTH (by inhibition) activity plays a beta - like

role that allows for the liberation of GnRH be it from CRH,

low FSH/LH or other factors.

Central: Thyro - somatogonadotropic

Thyro - somatotropic activity also regulates gonadotropic

function. TRH directly relaunches GnRH to relaunch FSH

activity. However, when TRH stimulates prolactin (PL), PL

alters the pulsatile frequency of GnRH release to favor LH

activity, diminishing FSH activity (Fig. 4.4).

Recall that TRH and PL have an endocrine action on

the corticotropic axis. This calibration of CRH and ACTH

indirectly regulates the production and timing of excretion

of GnRH, FSH, and LH. However, the action of TRH and

PL on GnRH does not follow this pattern (Fig. 4.5). It is a more complex and complimentary series of actions that occur both centrally and peripherally (discussed later).

FIG. 4.5 Multiaxial regulation of central gonadotropic factors. The thyro - somatotropic axis of TRH - PL in addition to regulating FSH and LH production directly (see Fig. 4.4), it also relaunches CRH during the turning of the endocrine loops from first to second. CRH and ACTH have the para - like, alpha - like, and beta - like action on GnRH, FSH and LH as previously described. Considering the direct stimulating actions of both TRH and PL, one can observe multiaxial regulation of FSH and LH production. The influence of TRH and PL serve to create a compensatory level of gonadic regulation of metabolism in the face of anticipated thyro - somatotropic anabolic fashioning.

This can affect peak progesterone days (16 - 25).

Central - peripheral

thyro - somatogonadotropic

Returning to the relationship of thyro - somatotropic activ-

ity on the gonadotropic axis, we find the relationship to

be more nuanced and complex (Fig. 4.8). As noted earlier (Fig. 4.4), TRH relaunches FSH and PL relaunches LH. However, while altering central gonadotropic activity, both TRH and PL amplify estrogen’s endocrinometabolic activ-

The sum of these relationships is shown in Fig. 4.8.

FIG. 4.7 ACTH stimulates cortisol. There is in the periphery a certain level of circulating estrogens. Estrogens can reduce free cortisol by stimulating its binding to CBG. Thus, at this first time, cortisol stimulates the binding of a certain portion of circulating free estrogens to SHBG. This allows a time for cortisol to liberate a material that estrogens will use at a later time. ACTH stimulates FSH in order to calibrate the intensity of FSH’s future action to the intensity of ACTH’s current vertical action. The rising levels of cortisol stimulated by ACTH allow for cortisol to calibrate and delay the release of FSH while cortisol engages in its action. Cortisol calibrates FSH to what it anticipates will be achieved in the periphery. In the second loop, the relationship and logic is the same. ACTH relaunches cortisol, which plays its alpha - like role on LH with respect to gonadal androgen production.

FIG. 5.3 Overview of the follicular causes of metrorrhagia. There are three general categories for insufficient estrogens resulting in metrorrhagia: (1) reduced availability, (2) insufficient stimulation, and (3) inhibition. Reduced availability can occur due to three reasons (1, 2a, 2b) related to corticotropic action on the gonadotropic axis. Insufficient stimulation can be due to insufficient central gonadotropic regulation that is endogenous or from early switch of GnRH pulsatility to favor LH and luteal hormones (2c). Inhibition is related to dopamine action on FSH (3). See text for details. (© 2016 Systems Biology Research Group.)

The general level of optimal endocrine activity is recapitulated. Estrogen activity (E2) declines after ovulation. If it declines too quickly on days 15 - 19, there will be metrorrhagia.

In the graph, the relationship of total and free testosterone, LH and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are demonstrated in men categorized by body mass index range (green: normal, blue: over - weight, and red: obese). The problem men face is not the quan - titative production capability of testosterone per se (upper left), which declines only by 10% between 40 and 80 years of age. The problem is the rise in SHBG, by 50%-80% over this same time period (bottom right). Thus one notes a 25%-30% decline in free testosterone (upper right) which is progressive over three decades (50 - 80 years). Finally, LH response, as measured by serum levels, to this decline is delayed by 20 - 25 years. It is only in the 70's that one notes doubling of LH in compensation.

It consists of three The term acne refers to a dermatologic condition that in- layers from outer to inner layers: epidermis, dermis, and volves comedones, papules, pustules, and/or cystic lesions. hypodermis. The epidermis is of ectodermal origin and is A hair follicle is a pilosebaceous exocrine gland. Thus, it therefore most influenced by the thyrotropic axis.

excrete the waste products. The result of oversolicitation

of the exocrine pancreas is increased uptake of nutrients,

especially proteins (Fig. 8.3). During the critical response, this oversupply of nutrients will be focused on the skin, supporting a hypermetabolism of the skin. NB: The emunctory congestion of the skin (precritical terrain) arises before the hypermetabolism (critical terrain).

insufficiency: (1) greater demand for gonadal androgens in

men than women, (2) greater capacity for adrenal androgen

production, and (3) less estrogens than women. Conversely,

in adulthood, acne in women occurs in a ratio of 2.5:1 vs

men. 3, 39 In women, acne arises primarily from a relative or absolute insufficiency of progesterone, such as occurrence of premenstrual and catamenial acne,38 or it may be a more chronic structuro - functional disorder.

Exacerbating factors: Neuroendocrine

Gonadotropic

The hyper LH solicits a relaunching of FSH to meet the

level of solicitation of LH. In the acne terrain, we observe

two relationships and several downstream events. The first

antidesquamatory, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial. Many

pharmaceutical products have some combination of these ac-

gen inhibitors. Glucocorticoids can be used topically, or

orally in more extreme cases of acne. Oral contraceptives

have three effects understood to be helpful in acne. The

first is their estrogenic activity, which can counterbalance

androgens and stimulate SHBG’s binding of androgens.

The second is an upregulation of the production of SHBG

local somatotropic endocrine activity as well as global en-

gotonic patients. One has allergies, the other asthma. There

is a genetic predisposition in the first to respond to the over-

solicitation demand for proteins. In the second case, since

asthma is also a hyperimmune state, the same overabsorp-

tion of proteins exist, but there is also an overabsorption of

glucose that congests the lungs that was not present in the

first, allergic patient, assuming they have a similar diet.

The purpose of the DT in providing materials at the cellu-

lar level justifies every aspect of the structural and functional

activity of the DT: its length, duration of transit, the specific

purpose of each of its constituent parts, their functional orga-

nization, the order of their sequence, and their connections.

The selection of nutrients is primarily programmed and not

limited to the simple extraction of substances used by the

body. It responds to the real needs, occasional and basic of

each cell, tissue, organ, system, function, and of the diges-

tive system and of each of its functions, including its func-

tional specificity at successive levels.

There is a need for a permanent and balanced parasympa-

thetic tonus to avoid the reflux at the time of the meal but

not excessive in order to avoid the risk of stagnation of the

food in the esophagus. The arrival of a bolus in the end por-

tion of the esophagus will distend the epiphrenic ampulla,

which then generates the alpha - sympathetic reaction rather

than beta - sympathetic discharge, allowing the opening of

LES sphincter during its lysis. There are other factors from

the downstream areas that are also involved, chemical or

hormonal in nature: Gastrin, secretin result in increased va-

gal tonus. Gastro - esophageal reflux disorder (GERD) can

arise due to insufficient LES tone, or excessive tone on the

pyloric sphincter of the distal stomach.58

According to an Endobiogenic nosology, GERD type 1

FIG. 10.1 Healthy intestinal tissue (left) maintains integrity through tight junctions. Water is exchanged across enterocytes through aquaporins. In bacterial - induced diarrhea (right), these elements are compromised. This results in entry of noncommensal organisms and loss of water into the enteric lumen, resulting in diarrhea.

FIG. 11.2 Structural factor of initiation (SFI) in Crohn’s disease. The SFI is a hyperfunctioning FSH, depicted by the heavy black arrow. The precritical terrain (lower left) is one of impaired adaptation in which catabolism exceeds anabolism and there is insufficient proteolytic enzymes to restore tissues (cf. Fig. 11.3 and text). This is the first step in compromising the quality of tissue. The second influence is the generally elevated cortisol activity (upper left) which delays anabolism, further impairing the general regulation of the cell cycle. Estrogen activity is hyperfunctioning, but not relative to the FSH demand. The demand created by estrogens for proteins is not sufficiently adapted (gray box). Estrogens, as is typical, relaunch LH and androgens, which initiate an intense protein utilization (red box) that exceeds the quality of estrogens in protein utilization. This is the final event that impairs the quality of mucosal tissue, resulting in a fragilization of the mucosa. (© 2015 Systems Biology Research Group.)

FIG. 11.3 Precritical terrain of Crohn’s disease. In addition to the structural factor of initiation (SFI), the precritical terrain fragilizes adapt - ability and the quality of the intestinal mucosa, in an attempt to compensate for the SFI hyper demand for proteins. In vagotonic patients, there is a hyperfunctioning parasympathetic tone to adapt exocrine pancreatic function (black arrow) to produce more proteolytic enzymes. The insuf - ficiency of the response (gray arrow) makes a reactive appeal (broken green arrow) back to para, resulting in a further rise in vagal tone. There is a reactive alpha - sympathetic surge in response to this (heavy red arrow), which favors catabolism (Cata) over anabolism (Ana). Alpha - sympathetic stimulates the parathyroid glands (black arrow) to adapt the level of calcium activity to assist in the adaptation demand it has installed. The para - thyroid hormone response is insufficient, thus, so is calcium response (gray arrow). This results in a reactive appeal (broken green arrow) to the sympathetic nervous system with a further reactive response in an (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to re - relaunch the parathyroid glands (broken red arrow). In sum, there is a catabolic predominance both due to alpha and insufficient proteolytic enzymes to repair injured intestinal mucosa. In addition, the patient is not prepared to face an aggression due to impaired precritical adaptability at the level of the parathyroid gland. (© 2015 Systems Biology Research Group.)

Alpha has a classic trépied relationship with prolactin

FIG. 11.8 Precritical terrain of ulcerative colitis. In vagotonic patients, there is an oversolicitation of the exocrine pancreas for general augmentation of digestive enzymes (black arrow). The response is insufficient (gray arrow), which solicits a reactive appeal (broken green arrow) which puts the patient in a hyperfunctioning parasympathetic state. This solicits a rise in alpha - sympathetic (black arrow) to match its tone. Alpha (αΣ) makes an appeal to beta - sympathetic (βΣ) which is delayed or blocked (gray broken arrow). This has two consequences: (1) blocked adaptation, (2) spasmophilia. Alpha also stimulates ACTH, and ACTH’s stimulation of the adrenal cortex is insufficient as well (broken gray arrow). This, along with a level of peripheral thyroid activity not sufficiently adaptated to alpha - sympathetic tone results in a total sympathetico - cortico - thyrotropic incompetence to adapt to future aggres - sions. The rising alpha tone that attempts to (unsuccessfully) readapt beta and adrenal cortex activity leads to a further reactive rise in parasympathetic tone (broken green arrow).

FIG. 11.9 Critical terrain of ulcerative colitis. It can be understood in three parts. The first is autonomic. Hyperfunctioning alpha (top center) stimulates a hyperfunctioning beta (adrenaline, top left), which favors hyperglycemia and inflammation. The second is the relaunching of the catabolic axes (center), again, by alpha. Central functioning exceeds peripheral gland response (gray, small print). The third is a disruption of the alpha - prolactin (PL)-growth hormone (GH) trépied (top right), discussed in Fig. 11.5. This participates in ulceration of distal colon mucosa.
