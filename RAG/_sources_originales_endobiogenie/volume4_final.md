FIG. 1.3 The central nervous system (CNS—upper left) is the locus of various perceptions, emotions, memories, and assessments of physiologic state. It creates a milieu or context which alters the threshold or amplitude of neuroendocrine response. For example, alpha sympathetic (αΣ) stimulates TRH, which in turn stimulates (1) the thyrotropic axis (far right, vertical), (2) the limbic area (upper left) affecting memory and emotions, (3) liberation of glu-cose (bottom panel, right to left). A patient with chronic rumination, activating the limbic area, may have an exaggerated alpha response. (© 2014 Systems Biology Research Group.)

Clinical Essentials of the

Somatotropic Axis

Introduction ● Glucagon: Endocrinometabolic: Glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, starter energy for adaptation, lipolysis.

The somatotropic axis is the second of two anabolic axes. ● Somatostatin: Endocrine : Inhibits glucagon, insulin. It is the great fashioner of structure and furnisher of energy.

It is the great runner of the endocrine loops. It ends the first Pathophysiology loop, and both starts and ends the second loop of adaptation. In sum, this axis sequences catabolism and anabolism. Imbalances originating in the somatotropic axis involve Because of the diverse functions of the axis, it is implicated disorder of structural integrity, structural adaptation, and in disorders of overgrowth (cysts, fibroids, adenosis) and functional adaptation (Table 11.1). There are disorders in-energy (hypoglycemia, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease), as trinsic to somatotropic function, such as keloids and wound well as disorders intrinsic to the endoderm: the digestive healing. When the gonadotropic axis is implicated, there tract, pancreas, and endothelial surface of hollow organs. are two general directions. The first arises from the gonadotropic axis. This can be gonado-thyro-somatotropic (c.f.

Notes

Days 1–10: (1) Brown rice is the only grain allowed, not required, (2) Olive oil is the only oil permissible, (3) Drink as much water with lemon juice as

desired, (4) Avoid: egg yolks, fried foods, sugars, nuts, beans, dates.

Days 4–7: (1) Eat as many sardines and apples as desired, (2) Organic apples only. Eat when oxidized and browned. Nonorganic apples either do not

oxidize or oxidize very slowly. You can grate them, cut into slices, bruise with a fork or a meat tenderizer (in a 1-gal freezer bag to prevent splatter), (3)

Apples can be eaten 30 min before sardines or 3 h after sardines but in no other order, (4) Judicious consumption of brown rice is permitted on these days

(1–2 cups total throughout the day).

Days 8–10: Adding foods from later days too early will upset your stomach and ruin the effects of the diet.

Notes

1. Perform diet once per year for general good health when grapes are in season.

2. Effects can be extended by eating a diet low in refined flour and sugar, low in animal fats and avoiding toxic products like cigarettes.

3. Grapes should be eaten every 60–90 min while awake to prevent an insulin surge.

4. Drink plenty of water to prevent constipation. Lemon water from the lemon diet accelerates the healing effects, alkalosis, and antithrombotic properties of the

diet.

5. Requires about 2 kg (4–5 lbs) grapes per day.

6. Red/black fruit diet can also be helpful in the autumn. Eat those fruits for 5 days after the 3-day preparation and 3-day wind-down.
